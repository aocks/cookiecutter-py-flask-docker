* Introduction

This project provides a [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][cookiecutter]] template for a dockerized project
for a python flask web server managed using an nginx reverse proxy.

The basic idea is to give you a simple way to start a new python
project which contains a web app (for browsers, APIs, or whatever)
with a few simple commands.

Ideally you should just be able to issue a command like

- =cookiecutter gh:aocks/cookiecutter-py-flask-docker=

and answer a few questions to get the skeleton for a web application
including things like:

- linting, testing, type checking
- docker-compose to run nginx and your flask application
- deployment scripts
- command line utilities

* Quickstart

First make sure you have [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][cookiecutter]] installed. If not, you can
install [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][cookiecutter]] via something like the following:
#+NAME: cpfd-install-cookiecutter
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session show-cpfd :exports code
cd /tmp                   # work in tmp dir to illustrate example
python3 -m venv venv      # create a virtualenv
. venv/bin/activate       # and activate it
pip install cookiecutter  # so you can install cookiecutter
#+END_SRC


Once you have [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][cookiecutter]] installed, use it with this template via:
#+NAME: cpfd-run-cookiecutter
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session show-cpfd :exports code
cookiecutter gh:aocks/cookiecutter-py-flask-docker  
#+END_SRC
and answer the questions. The following are some details about how the
fields requested and what they are used for:

- =github_username=:
  - This can be either your username or the name of your
    organization. 
- =project_slug=:
  - This will determine the name of your new project directory and is
    auto-generated from your project name to be allow lowercase with
    no space or hyphens.

Once you are done, [[https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter][cookiecutter]] will create a new directory for you
based on the =project_slug= value you specified. This directory has
everything you need for your python project. You can just do the
following to build and deploy docker containers to local ports (9080
for HTTP and 9443 for SSL by default)

#+NAME: cpfd-local-deploy
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session show-cpfd
cd python_boilerplate  # or whateer your project slug was
make local_deploy
#+END_SRC


* Implementation

This section describes the implementation details of how this
cookiecutter template works. It is mainly of interesting if you want
to extend the template. If you just want to use it, you can skip this
section.

** Setup

To start developing, testing, or extending this template you should do
the following:

 1. Clone from github:
    =cd ~/code && git clone git@github.com:cookiecutter-py-flask-docker.git=
 2. Move the resulting module into one which ends in =.git=:
    =mv cookiecutter-py-flask-docker cookiecutter-py-flask-docker.git=
    - The cookiecutter program wants to work with repos and will not
      run on something that does not look as expected.
    - You could also do =git clone --bare= above but then you will
      have to clone and commit an extra time.
 3. Edit files in the newly cloned repo and commit.
    - *IMPORTANT*: cookiecutter will only see commited files.
 4. Install cookiecutter (possibly in a venv).
 5. Change to a temporary directory so your boilerplate doesn't
    clutter your main code.
    - =cd /tmp=
 5. Run cookie cutter on the repo and answer the questions:
    - =cookiecutter ~/code/cookiecutter-py-flask-docker.git=
 6. Examine the newly created project, and repeat the steps above
    until the cookiecutter template produces what you want.
